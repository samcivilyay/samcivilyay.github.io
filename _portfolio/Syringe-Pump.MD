# Project Details/Features 

## The purpose of this project was to design and build a cost-effective, highly accurate syringe pump as an alternative to expensive commercial models. The key features of the design include:
* Precise liquid dispensing using a stepper motor and lead screw mechanism
* Multi-directional pump feature for filling and expelling liquids
* Compatibility with different syringe sizes (20 mL and 10 mL)
* LED indicator for operational status (green for running, yellow for paused, red for stopped)
* Modular design for effective disassembly and recycling of 3D-printed components
* Parameterized CAD design for easy modifications

| Part | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Stepper Motor | NEMA 17 with 1.8-degree angle (200 steps/revolution) |
| Lead Screw | 8 mm lead |
| Microcontroller | Elegoo Uno |
| Push Buttons | One latching, two non-latching |
| LED | Multicolored |
| Limit Switch | For stopping the motor when syringe is empty |
| Power Supply | Not specified in the report |
| Breadboard | For circuit connections |
| Aluminum Extrusion Bar | For mounting components |
