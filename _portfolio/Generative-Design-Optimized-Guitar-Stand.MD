## Introduction: Top-Down Modeling

* The bike phone mount is comprised of the following 3D printed components: 
  * Handlebar Clamp 1 (PLA)
  * Handlebar Clamp 2 (PLA)
  * Detent Spinner Mount (PLA)
  * Detent Spinner (PLA)
  * Phone Mount (TPU)
  * Handlebar Attachment Pin (PLA)
* The phone mount was printed from TPU to serve as a flexible mounting mechanism that the phone could snugly fit into. The other aforementioned components were printed from PLA to serve as rigid, structural components. The bike phone mount also includes the following off-the-shelf components: 
  * Socket Head Screws
  * Heat Set Inserts
  * Stainless Steel Ball Bearing
  * Compression Spring
